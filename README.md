## Setup 
- Make sure you have PHP8 & MySQL installed on your machine.
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the Database information to that of yours.
- Open your terminal/cmd, then run `composer install` to install all PHP related packages, then `npm install` for JS related packages.
- Run `php artisan migrate`(this create the tables required by the app in your DB) and `php artisan db:seed`(this insert dummy data into the table created.)
- Then run `npm run dev`(this compiles & builds our js), open another terminal/cmd then run `php artisan serve`(This starts laravel server to run the app)
